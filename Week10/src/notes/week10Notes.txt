using graphs

edges:
	Entity
vertices
	Connecting Lines

Seven Bridges of Konigsberg
	Graph Terminology


Graph: 
	G=(V, E)
	Directed Graph
	Undirected:
		no qualifier
	Cost: 
		Time
			Fastest Arrival Time
		Money
			Cheapest Combination of Flight(s)
	Adjacent Vertices
		next to each other
	Incident
	Degree
		How many edges go into the vertex
		Study
	Neighbor
	Loop
		Closed circuit of Edges & their Vertices

	simpleGraph:
		noLoops
	Parallel Edge
		

	Representing Graphs: {
		Nodes: 
			children associated with the Node can touch other nodes to make a loop
			Loops are permitted
		representing edges
		int[][] edges = {{0,1},{0,3}, {0,5}, {1,0}, 
	}//end Representing Graphs

Sparse Matrix: {
	matrix with a lot of zeros
	Look for another way to represent a sparse matrix
}

Graph Traversal
	Depth First (DFS)
		all children examined first
	Breadth First (BFS)
		layers
		one level at a time
		check all children
			>check ALL another node's children
				>loop(no double checks)

HomeWork:{
	short compared to other weeks,
	do this exercise,
		28.7,
			take the code from the book,
			unweightedGraph
				newClas: UnweightedGraphNonCycle
					StartingNode as parameter & cycle will have same node, or false
